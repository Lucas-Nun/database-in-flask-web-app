# my webapp made in flask.

## what was the purpose 

the purpose of this project was to see my ablity to link a webapp to a database which was quite succesfull 

## how is it used

the admin sigin in is ssn 1 and password 1 which gives access to the admin dashboard. the database can now edited and viewed. users can be added and removed by inputting all the boxes on the web page 

## validation 

validation is limited due to time but the database will roll back if a user is added that does not meet the requirements.

## safety

the admin page can be accesed by typing /admin at the end making it completely insecure
